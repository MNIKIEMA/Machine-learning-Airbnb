This
story
takes
place
in
its
own
universe
.
It
has
no
connection
to
any
of
the
DC
films
that
have
come
before
it
.
We
see
it
as
a
classic
Warner
Bros
.
movie
.
Gritty
, 
intimate
and 
oddly 
funny
, 
the 
characters 
live 
in 
the 
real 
world 
and
the 
stakes 
are 
personal
.
Although 
it 
is 
never 
mentioned 
in 
the 
film
, 
this 
story 
takes
place 
in 
the 
past
.
Let
'
s 
call 
it 
1981
.  
It
'
s 
a 
troubled 
time
. 
The 
crime 
rate 
in 
Gotham 
is 
at 
record
highs
. 
A 
garbage 
strike 
has 
crippled 
the 
city 
for 
the 
past
six 
weeks
. 
And 
the 
divide 
between 
the 
"
haves
" 
and 
the 
"
have
-
nots
" 
is 
palpable
. 
Dreams 
are 
beyond 
reach
, 
slipping 
into
delusions
.
OVER 
BLACK
:
HEAR
LAUGHTER
.
The 
sound 
of 
a 
man 
totally 
cracking 
up
.
FADE

MORNING                          1
CLOSE 
ON 
JOKER 
(
30
'
s
)
, 
tears
in 
his 
eyes 
from 
laughing 
so
hard
. 
He
'
s 
trying 
to get 
it 
under 
control
. 
His 
greasy
, 
black
hair 
is 
matted 
down
. 
He
'
s 
wearing 
an 
old
, 
faded 
red 
hooded
zip
-
up 
sweatshirt
, 
a 
threadbare 
gray 
scarf
, 
thin 
from 
years
of 
use
, 
hangs 
loosely
around
his
neck
.
WE
NOTICE
TWO 
FADED
OLD
SCARS
cut
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
.
Almost
forming
a
smile
.
He
'
s
sitting
across
from
an
overworked
SOCIAL
WORKER
(
50
'
s
)
,
African
American
.
Her 
office
is
cramped
and
run
-
down
in
a
cramped
and
run
-
down
building
.
Stacks
of
folders
piled
high
in
front
of
her
.
She 
just
sits
behind
her
desk
,
waiting
for
his
laughing
fit
to
end
,
she
'
s
been
through
this
before
.
Finally
it
subsides
.
Joker
takes
a
deep
breath
,
pauses
to
see
if 
it
'
s 
over
.
Beat
.
